Reddit Revamped
=========================

A RES-friendly, clean, and minimal <a href = "http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> style for both Chrome and Firefox. Supports RES night mode.

For screenshots, see the <a href ="https://userstyles.org/styles/90951/reddit-revamped">userstyles entry</a> for this style.

Should be used with the <a href = "https://userstyles.org/">Stylish</a> Firefox/Chrome addon. Install using the <a href ="https://userstyles.org/styles/90951/reddit-revamped">userstyles entry</a>.

Based on a previous version of <a href = "http://userstyles.org/styles/71917/aerial-a-css-style-for-reddit-res-compatible">Reddit Aerial.</a>


Caution: <ul>
<li>Some of the removed elements had functionality, most notably the top subreddit bar and the footer.</li>
<li>The layout will not work properly on lower resolutions.</li>
<li>As with most custom styles, this <strong>does not work with Subreddit-specific styles!</strong> -> make sure they are always turned off in your Reddit settings! (Or just untick "Use subreddit style" in each subreddit.) No way around this.</li>
<li>Alignment might be a bit off if you are not using RES.</li>
</ul>
